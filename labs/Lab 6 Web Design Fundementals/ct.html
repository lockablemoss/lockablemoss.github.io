        <h2><strong>Color Terminology</strong></h2>
            <p>These are some examples of colors used on different websites</p>
    <h2>SCPS Homepage</h2>
            <a href="https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/"><img src="images/scps.PNG" alt="https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/"></a>
        <p>This website is mainly white, but it uses warm colors as accents for the page. The announcment and some buttons are in yellow and some accents are in red making the webpage more warm.</p>

     <h2>Google Homepage</h2>
            <a href="google.com"><img src="images/google.PNG" alt="Google.com"></a>
        <p>This webpage is very simple and is really only white. But the logo and accents like the small microphone uses an almost even amount of warm and cool colors.</p>
    
     <h2>Discord Homepage</h2>
            <img src="images/discord.PNG" alt="Discord.com"">
        <p>This webpage is almost all black with white and purple accents. This webpage has a cool temperture.</p>

     <h2>GOG Homepage</h2>
            <a href="GOG.com"><img src="images/gog.PNG" alt="GOG.com"></a>
        <p>This webpage also is very white but it uses purple as its main accent color. This would make the webpage cool.</p>
